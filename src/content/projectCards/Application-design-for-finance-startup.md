  Foodiez is a comprehensive restaurant website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The platform features an intuitive user interface for customers to browse menus, make reservations, and place online orders. Key features include real-time order tracking, secure payment integration, and an admin dashboard for restaurant owners to manage menu items, track orders, and analyze sales data. The responsive design ensures a seamless experience across all devices, while the backend API handles authentication, order processing, and database operations efficiently.
