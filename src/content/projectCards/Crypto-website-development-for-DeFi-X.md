      The Markdown syntax allows you to create code blocks by indenting lines by
      four spaces or one tab. If you find that inconvenient, try using fenced
      code blocks. To do that, you’ll use three backticks (```) on the lines
      before and after the code block. The best part? You don’t have to indent
      any lines!
