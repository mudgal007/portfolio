    title: Framework Preferences
    text: >-
      I have a strong preference for frameworks that combine efficiency, scalability, and flexibility to streamline development workflows. React.js stands out as my go-to frontend framework due to its component-based architecture and seamless integration capabilities. For backend development, I often rely on Node.js and Express.js, which offer exceptional performance and a vast ecosystem. These frameworks enable me to deliver robust and scalable solutions tailored to meet diverse project requirements.
